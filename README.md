## Overview

Road segmentation is a crucial task in computer vision and geospatial analysis. It has broad applications, such as autonomous driving, urban planning, and GIS mapping. In this project, we focused on segmenting roads from aerial images using machine learning models.

Key components of the project include:
- **Model Architectures:** Implementation of U-Net, DeepLabv3+, and SegFormer models.
- **Post-Processing:** Utilized Morphological Operations and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) for refining segmentation outputs.
- **Ensemble Learning:** Combined predictions from multiple models using majority voting to improve results.
- **Data Augmentation:** Applied geometric transformations, random crops, image degradations, and color transforms to enhance training data diversity.

## Features

- Semantic segmentation using state-of-the-art CNN and Transformer models.
- Comprehensive performance evaluation of individual models and their ensemble.
- Advanced post-processing techniques to refine segmentation.
- Ethical risk assessment and sustainability considerations in machine learning projects.

## Post-Processing

Post-processing techniques were applied to refine the outputs of the segmentation models and improve overall performance. Two primary approaches were utilized:

### 1. Morphological Operations

Morphological operations such as erosion, dilation, opening, and closing were employed to enhance the smoothness of the binary segmentation outputs. These techniques are especially useful for correcting small errors in road boundaries. 

- **Erosion and Dilation:** These operations adjust the size of detected road regions. While erosion removes small false positives, dilation expands true positives.
- **Opening and Closing:** Combined operations were used to balance removal of noise and preservation of road shapes, providing minor improvements in segmentation accuracy.

### 2. Conditional Random Fields (CRFs)

Conditional Random Fields were used as a refinement step to improve the connectivity and sharpness of road segment predictions:
- **Pairwise Gaussians:** Fully-connected CRFs applied pairwise Gaussian potentials to penalize discontinuities between nearby pixels, enhancing smoothness and connectivity of road networks.
- **Custom Hyperparameters:** Specific tuning of CRF parameters improved performance by adapting to the long and thin nature of roads, as well as their orientation.

CRFs demonstrated their utility in filling gaps in road segments and ensuring that road edges were more sharply defined. However, care was needed to avoid over-smoothing, particularly in areas with complex road intersections.

Overall, the combination of these post-processing techniques resulted in more polished and accurate segmentation outputs.

## Ethical Considerations

- **Privacy Risks:** Satellite or aerial imagery may capture private properties, posing potential privacy concerns. Mitigation strategies, such as geospatial cryptography, can address these risks.
- **Fairness Issues:** The dataset primarily contains roads from Western landscapes, leading to possible biases. Expanding the dataset to include roads from diverse regions would improve fairness.
- **Sustainability:** The training process utilized limited computational resources, minimizing environmental impact.

## Future Work

- Increase dataset diversity to include underrepresented road designs and regions.
- Enhance post-processing methods to handle complex and curved road patterns.
- Explore graph-based approaches for further segmentation improvements.
