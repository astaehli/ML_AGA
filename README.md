# RoadFormer: Road Segmentation using Transformers

This repository contains the implementation and analysis of the **RoadFormer** project, developed for road segmentation from aerial imagery. The work explores and evaluates various machine learning architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models, enhanced with data augmentation, ensemble learning, and post-processing techniques like Conditional Random Fields (CRFs).

## Overview

Road segmentation is a crucial task in computer vision and geospatial analysis. It has broad applications, such as autonomous driving, urban planning, and GIS mapping. In this project, we focused on segmenting roads from aerial images using machine learning models.

Key components of the project include:
- **Model Architectures:** Implementation of U-Net, DeepLabv3+, and SegFormer models.
- **Post-Processing:** Utilized Morphological Operations and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) for refining segmentation outputs.
- **Ensemble Learning:** Combined predictions from multiple models using majority voting to improve results.
- **Data Augmentation:** Applied geometric transformations, random crops, image degradations, and color transforms to enhance training data diversity.

### Performance Metrics

| Model         | F1-Score | Accuracy | Precision | Recall  |
|---------------|----------|----------|-----------|---------|
| U-Net         | 0.8148   | 0.9269   | 0.8803    | 0.7584  |
| DeepLabV3+    | 0.8608   | 0.9409   | 0.8595    | 0.8621  |
| **SegFormer** | **0.8766** | **0.9484** | **0.8893** | **0.8642** |
| Ensemble      | 0.8726   | 0.9474   | 0.8981    | 0.8484  |

Our best-performing model, **SegFormer**, achieved the highest F1 score and accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately identifying road segments.

## Ethical Considerations

- **Privacy Risks:** Satellite or aerial imagery may capture private properties, posing potential privacy concerns. Mitigation strategies, such as geospatial cryptography, can address these risks.
- **Fairness Issues:** The dataset primarily contains roads from Western landscapes, leading to possible biases. Expanding the dataset to include roads from diverse regions would improve fairness.
- **Sustainability:** The training process utilized limited computational resources, minimizing environmental impact.

## Future Work

- Increase dataset diversity to include underrepresented road designs and regions.
- Enhance post-processing methods to handle complex and curved road patterns.
- Explore graph-based approaches for further segmentation improvements.
